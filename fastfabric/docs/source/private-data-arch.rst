Private Data
============

.. note:: This topic assumes an understand of the conceptual material in the
          `documentation on private data <private-data/private-data.html>`_.

Private data collection definition
----------------------------------

A collection definition contains one or more collections, each having a policy
definition listing the organizations in the collection, as well as properties
used to control endorsement and, optionally, whether the data will be purged.

The collection definition gets deployed to the channel at the time of chaincode
instantiation. If using the peer CLI to instantiate the chaincode, the
collection definition file is passed to the chaincode instantiation
using the ``--collections-config`` flag. If using a client SDK, check the `SDK
documentation <https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/>`_ for information on providing the collection
definition.

Collection definitions are composed of five properties:

* ``name``: Name of the collection.

* ``policy``: Defines the organization peers allowed to persist the collection
  data expressed using the ``Signature`` policy syntax, with each member being
  included in an ``OR`` signature policy list.

* ``requiredPeerCount``: Minimum number of peers that the endorsing peer must
  successfully disseminate private data to before the peer signs the
  endorsement and returns the proposal response back to the client. When
  ``requiredPeerCount`` is ``0``, it means that no distribution is **required**,
  but there may be some distribution if ``maxPeerCount`` is greater than zero. A
  ``requiredPeerCount`` of ``0`` would typically not be recommended, as it could
  lead to loss of private data. Typically you would want to require at least some
  distribution of the private data at endorsement time to ensure redundancy of the
  private data on multiple peers in the network.

* ``maxPeerCount``: For data redundancy purposes, the number of other peers
  that the current endorsing peer will attempt to distribute the data to. If an
  endorsing peer becomes unavailable between endorsement time and commit time,
  other peers that are collection members but who did not yet receive the private
  data, will be able to pull the private data from the peers the private data was
  disseminated to. If this value is set to ``0``, the private data is not
  disseminated at endorsement time, forcing private data pulls on all authorized
  peers.

* ``blockToLive``: Represents how long the data should live on the private
  database in terms of blocks. The data will live for this specified number of
  blocks on the private database and after that it will get purged, making this
  data obsolete from the network. To keep private data indefinitely, that is, to
  never purge private data, set the ``blockToLive`` property to ``0``.

Here is a sample collection definition JSON file, containing an array of two
collection definitions:

.. code:: bash

 [
  {
     "name": "collectionMarbles",
     "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member', 'Org2MSP.member')",
     "requiredPeerCount": 0,
     "maxPeerCount": 3,
     "blockToLive":1000000
  },
  {
     "name": "collectionMarblePrivateDetails",
     "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member')",
     "requiredPeerCount": 0,
     "maxPeerCount": 3,
     "blockToLive":3
  }
 ]

This example uses the organizations from the BYFN sample network, ``Org1`` and
``Org2`` . The policy in the  ``collectionMarbles`` definition authorizes both
organizations to the private data. This is a typical configuration when the
chaincode data needs to remain private from the ordering service nodes. However,
the policy in the ``collectionMarblePrivateDetails`` definition restricts access
to a subset of organizations in the channel (in this case ``Org1`` ). In a real
scenario, there would be many organizations in the channel, with two or more
organizations in each collection sharing private data between them.

How private data is committed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When authorized peers do not have a copy of the private data in their transient
data store they will attempt to pull the private data from another authorized
peer, *for a configurable amount of time* based on the peer property
``peer.gossip.pvtData.pullRetryThreshold`` in the peer configuration ``core.yaml``
file.

.. note:: The peers being asked for private data will only return the private data
          if the requesting peer is a member of the collection as defined by the
          policy.

Considerations when using ``pullRetryThreshold``:

* If the requesting peer is able to retrieve the private data within the
  ``pullRetryThreshold``, it will commit the transaction to its ledger
  (including the private data hash), and store the private data in its
  state database, logically separated from other channel state data.

* If the requesting peer is not able to retrieve the private data within
  the ``pullRetryThreshold``, it will commit the transaction to it’s blockchain
  (including the private data hash), without the private data.

* If the peer was entitled to the private data but it is missing, then
  that the peer will not be able to endorse future transactions that reference
  the missing private data - a chaincode query for a key that is missing will
  be detected (based on the presence of the key’s hash in the state database),
  and the chaincode will receive an error.

Therefore, it is important to set the ``requiredPeerCount`` and ``maxPeerCount``
properties large enough to ensure the availability of private data in your
channel. For example, if each of the endorsing peers become unavailable
before the transaction commits, the ``requiredPeerCount`` and ``maxPeerCount``
properties will have ensured the private data is available on other peers.

.. note:: For collections to work, it is important to have cross organizational
          gossip configured correctly. Refer to our documentation on :doc:`gossip`,
          paying particular attention to the section on "anchor peers".

Endorsement
~~~~~~~~~~~

The endorsing peer plays an important role in disseminating private data to
other authorized peers, ensuring the availability of private data on the
channel. To assist with this dissemination, the  ``maxPeerCount`` and
``requiredPeerCount`` properties in the collection definition control the
dissemination behavior.

If the endorsing peer cannot successfully disseminate the private data to at least
the ``requiredPeerCount``, it will return an error back to the client. The endorsing
peer will attempt to disseminate the private data to peers of different organizations,
in an effort to ensure that each authorized organization has a copy of the private
data. Since transactions are not committed at chaincode execution time, the endorsing
peer and recipient peers store a copy of the private data in a local ``transient store``
alongside their blockchain until the transaction is committed.

Referencing collections from chaincode
--------------------------------------

A set of `shim APIs <https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim>`_
are available for setting and retrieving private data.

The same chaincode data operations can be applied to channel state data and
private data, but in the case of private data, a collection name is specified
along with the data in the chaincode APIs, for example
``PutPrivateData(collection,key,value)`` and ``GetPrivateData(collection,key)``.

A single chaincode can reference multiple collections.

How to pass private data in a chaincode proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the chaincode proposal gets stored on the blockchain, it is also important
not to include private data in the main part of the chaincode proposal. A special
field in the chaincode proposal called the ``transient`` field can be used to pass
private data from the client (or data that chaincode will use to generate private
data), to chaincode invocation on the peer.  The chaincode can retrieve the
``transient`` field by calling the ```GetTransient()`` API <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/13447bf5ead693f07285ce63a1903c5d0d25f096/core/chaincode/shim/interfaces_stable.go>`_.
This ``transient`` field gets excluded from the channel transaction.

Considerations when using private data
--------------------------------------

Querying Private Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Private collection data can be queried just like normal channel data, using
shim APIs:

* ``GetPrivateDataByRange(collection, startKey, endKey string)``
* ``GetPrivateDataByPartialCompositeKey(collection, objectType string, keys []string)``

And for the CouchDB state database, JSON content queries can be passed using the
shim API:

* ``GetPrivateDataQueryResult(collection, query string)``

Limitations:

* Clients that call chaincode that executes range or rich JSON queries should be aware
  that they may receive a subset of the result set, if the peer they query has missing
  private data, based on the explanation in Private Data Dissemination section
  above.  Clients can query multiple peers and compare the results to
  determine if a peer may be missing some of the result set.
* Chaincode that executes range or rich JSON queries and updates data in a single
  transaction is not supported, as the query results cannot be validated on the peers
  that don’t have access to the private data, or on peers that are missing the
  private data that they have access to. If a chaincode invocation both queries
  and updates private data, the proposal request will return an error. If your application
  can tolerate result set changes between chaincode execution and validation/commit time,
  then you could call one chaincode function to perform the query, and then call a second
  chaincode function to make the updates. Note that calls to GetPrivateData() to retrieve
  individual keys can be made in the same transaction as PutPrivateData() calls, since
  all peers can validate key reads based on the hashed key version.
* Note that private data collections only define which organization’s peers
  are authorized to receive and store private data, and consequently implies
  which peers can be used to query private data. Private data collections do not
  by themselves limit access control within chaincode. For example if
  non-authorized clients are able to invoke chaincode on peers that have access
  to the private data, the chaincode logic still needs a means to enforce access
  control as usual, for example by calling the GetCreator() chaincode API or
  using the client identity `chaincode library <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/core/chaincode/lib/cid>`__ .

Using Indexes with collections
------------------------------

The topic :doc:`couchdb_as_state_database` describes indexes that can be
applied to the channel’s state database to enable JSON content queries, by
packaging indexes in a ``META-INF/statedb/couchdb/indexes`` directory at chaincode
installation time.  Similarly, indexes can also be applied to private data
collections, by packaging indexes in a ``META-INF/statedb/couchdb/collections/<collection_name>/indexes``
directory. An example index is available `here <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/chaincode/marbles02_private/go/META-INF/statedb/couchdb/collections/collectionMarbles/indexes/indexOwner.json>`_.

Private Data Purging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To keep private data indefinitely, that is, to never purge private data,
set ``blockToLive`` property to ``0``.

Recall that prior to commit, peers store private data in a local
transient data store. This data automatically gets purged when the transaction
commits.  But if a transaction was never submitted to the channel and
therefore never committed, the private data would remain in each peer’s
transient store.  This data is purged from the transient store after a
configurable number blocks by using the peer’s
``peer.gossip.pvtData.transientstoreMaxBlockRetention`` property in the peer
``core.yaml`` file.

Upgrading a collection definition
---------------------------------

If a collection is referenced by a chaincode, the chaincode will use the prior
collection definition unless a new collection definition is specified at upgrade
time. If a collection configuration is specified during the upgrade, a definition
for each of the existing collections must be included, and you can add new
collection definitions.

Collection updates becomes effective when a peer commits the block that
contains the chaincode upgrade transaction. Note that collections cannot be
deleted, as there may be prior private data hashes on the channel’s blockchain
that cannot be removed.
