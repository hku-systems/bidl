How to Use MiniRun Template
===========================

The files that need to be configured according to your setup:

- ``group_vars/all.yml`` -- configuration applied to all nodes
- ``group_vars/nodes_special.yml`` -- configuration only applied to special nodes

NOTE: see ``app/run.yml`` for all available options passed to the app

- ``nodes.ini``

  - ``nodes_setup`` section: list the distinct machines that are used to host nodes
  - ``nodes`` section: list the regular nodes
  - ``nodes_special`` section: list the special nodes (you can customize your own)
- ``nodes.yml`` is the yaml version of ``nodes.ini``, *not* used by default

  NOTE: the same machine could host multiple nodes at the same time, to allow
  such multi-node hosts, use an unique ``host_idx=`` to distinguish them

Then install/setup the required environment on all machines (assuming the ssh
info in ``group_vars/all.yml`` has sudo permision without password, such as
``ubuntu`` user in an AWS instance).

::

    ./run.sh setup

Start a run of all nodes named ``deployment1``:
::

    ./run.sh new deployment1

Check whether all nodes are up and running:
::

    ./run.sh check deployment1

Stop an existing run:
::

    ./run.sh stop deployment1

Fetch the outputs generated by the nodes:
::

    ./run.sh fetch deployment1

The outputs will be in deployment1/remote

Start the same run again (after stopping it):
::

    ./run.sh start deployment1

Reset the run (database, logs and rebuild):
::

    ./run.sh reset deployment1
