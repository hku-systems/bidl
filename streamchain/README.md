# StreamChain-Benchmarking

This project is a collection of scripts and code that benchmark StreamChain (and Hyperledger Fabric) using a YCSB-like workload and a Supply Chain Management (SCM) application.

This is work in progress and merged from several internal repositories. Please reach out in case you'd like to use to so we can assist you in the bootstrapping process.
