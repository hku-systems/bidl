Endorsement policies
====================

Every chaincode has an endorsement policy which specifies the set of peers on
a channel that must execute chaincode and endorse the execution results in
order for the transaction to be considered valid. These endorsement policies
define the organizations (through their peers) who must "endorse" (i.e., approve
of) the execution of a proposal.

.. note :: Recall that **state**, represented by key-value pairs, is separate
           from blockchain data. For more on this, check out our :doc:`ledger/ledger`
           documentation.

As part of the transaction validation step performed by the peers, each validating
peer checks to make sure that the transaction contains the appropriate **number**
of endorsements and that they are from the expected sources (both of these are
specified in the endorsement policy). The endorsements are also checked to make
sure they're valid (i.e., that they are valid signatures from valid certificates).

Two ways to require endorsement
-------------------------------

By default, endorsement policies are specified for a channel's chaincode at
instantiation or upgrade time (that is, one endorsement policy covers all of the
state associated with a chaincode).

However, there are cases where it may be necessary for a particular state (a
particular key-value pair, in other words) to have a different endorsement policy.
This **state-based endorsement** allows the default chaincode-level endorsement
policies to be overridden by a different policy for the specified keys.

To illustrate the circumstances in which these two types of endorsement policies
might be used, consider a channel on which cars are being exchanged. The "creation"
--- also known as "issuance" -- of a car as an asset that can be traded (putting
the key-value pair that represents it into the world state, in other words) would
have to satisfy the chaincode-level endorsement policy. To see how to set a
chaincode-level endorsement policy, check out the section below.

If the car requires a specific endorsement policy, it can be defined either when
the car is created or afterwards. There are a number of reasons why it might
be necessary or preferable to set a state-specific endorsement policy. The car
might have historical importance or value that makes it necessary to have the
endorsement of a licensed appraiser. Also, the owner of the car (if they're a
member of the channel) might also want to ensure that their peer signs off on a
transaction. In both cases, **an endorsement policy is required for a particular
asset that is different from the default endorsement policies for the other
assets associated with that chaincode.**

We'll show you how to define a state-based endorsement policy in a subsequent
section. But first, let's see how we set a chaincode-level endorsement policy.

Setting chaincode-level endorsement policies
--------------------------------------------

Chaincode-level endorsement policies can be specified at instantiate time using
either the SDK (for some sample code on how to do this, click
`here <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/f8ffa90dc1b61a4a60a6fa25de760c647587b788/test/integration/e2e/e2eUtils.js#L178>`_)
or in the peer CLI using the ``-P`` switch followed by the policy.

.. note:: Don't worry about the policy syntax (``'Org1.member'``, et all) right
          now. We'll talk more about the syntax in the next section.

For example:

::

    peer chaincode instantiate -C <channelid> -n mycc -P "AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')"

This command deploys chaincode ``mycc`` ("my chaincode") with the policy
``AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')`` which would require that a member of both
Org1 and Org2 sign the transaction.

Notice that, if the identity classification is enabled (see :doc:`msp`),
one can use the ``PEER`` role to restrict endorsement to only peers.

For example:

::

    peer chaincode instantiate -C <channelid> -n mycc -P "AND('Org1.peer', 'Org2.peer')"

A new organization added to the channel after instantiation can query a chaincode
(provided the query has appropriate authorization as defined by channel policies
and any application level checks enforced by the chaincode) but will not be able
to execute or endorse the chaincode. The endorsement policy needs to be modified
to allow transactions to be committed with endorsements from the new organization.

.. note:: if not specified at instantiation time, the endorsement policy
          defaults to "any member of the organizations in the channel".
          For example, a channel with "Org1" and "Org2" would have a default
          endorsement policy of "OR('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')".

Endorsement policy syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see above, policies are expressed in terms of principals
("principals" are identities matched to a role). Principals are described as
``'MSP.ROLE'``, where ``MSP`` represents the required MSP ID and ``ROLE``
represents one of the four accepted roles: ``member``, ``admin``, ``client``, and
``peer``.

Here are a few examples of valid principals:

  - ``'Org0.admin'``: any administrator of the ``Org0`` MSP
  - ``'Org1.member'``: any member of the ``Org1`` MSP
  - ``'Org1.client'``: any client of the ``Org1`` MSP
  - ``'Org1.peer'``: any peer of the ``Org1`` MSP

The syntax of the language is:

``EXPR(E[, E...])``

Where ``EXPR`` is either ``AND``, ``OR``, or ``OutOf``, and ``E`` is either a
principal (with the syntax described above) or another nested call to ``EXPR``.

For example:
  - ``AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member', 'Org3.member')`` requests one signature
    from each of the three principals.
  - ``OR('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')`` requests one signature from either one
    of the two principals.
  - ``OR('Org1.member', AND('Org2.member', 'Org3.member'))`` requests either one
    signature from a member of the ``Org1`` MSP or one signature from a member
    of the ``Org2`` MSP and one signature from a member of the ``Org3`` MSP.
  - ``OutOf(1, 'Org1.member', 'Org2.member')``, which resolves to the same thing
    as ``OR('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')``.
  - Similarly, ``OutOf(2, 'Org1.member', 'B.member')`` is equivalent to
    ``AND('Org1.member', 'Org2.member')``.

.. _key-level-endorsement:

Setting key-level endorsement policies
--------------------------------------

Setting regular chaincode-level endorsement policies is tied to the lifecycle of
the corresponding chaincode. They can only be set or modified when instantiating
or upgrading the corresponding chaincode on a channel.

In contrast, key-level endorsement policies can be set and modified in a more
granular fashion from within a chaincode. The modification is part of the
read-write set of a regular transaction.

The shim API provides the following functions to set and retrieve an endorsement
policy for/from a regular key.

.. note:: ``ep`` below stands for the "endorsement policy", which can be expressed
          either by using the same syntax described above or by using the
          convenience function described below. Either method will generate a
          binary version of the endorsement policy that can be consumed by the
          basic shim API.

.. code-block:: Go

    SetStateValidationParameter(key string, ep []byte) error
    GetStateValidationParameter(key string) ([]byte, error)

For keys that are part of :doc:`private-data/private-data` in a collection the
following functions apply:

.. code-block:: Go

    SetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string, ep []byte) error
    GetPrivateDataValidationParameter(collection, key string) ([]byte, error)

To help set endorsement policies and marshal them into validation
parameter byte arrays, the shim provides convenience functions that allow the
chaincode developer to deal with endorsement policies in terms of the MSP
identifiers of organizations:

.. code-block:: Go

    type KeyEndorsementPolicy interface {
        // Policy returns the endorsement policy as bytes
        Policy() ([]byte, error)

        // AddOrgs adds the specified orgs to the list of orgs that are required
        // to endorse
        AddOrgs(roleType RoleType, organizations ...string) error

        // DelOrgs delete the specified channel orgs from the existing key-level endorsement
        // policy for this KVS key. If any org is not present, an error will be returned.
        DelOrgs([]string) error

        // DelAllOrgs removes any key-level endorsement policy from this KVS key.
        DelAllOrgs() error

        // ListOrgs returns an array of channel orgs that are required to endorse changes
        ListOrgs() ([]string, error)
    }

For example, to set an endorsement policy for a key where two specific orgs are
required to endorse the key change, pass both org ``MSPIDs`` to ``AddOrgs()``,
and then call ``Policy()`` to construct the endorsement policy byte array that
can be passed to ``SetStateValidationParameter()``.

Validation
----------

At commit time, setting a value of a key is no different from setting the
endorsement policy of a key --- both update the state of the key and are
validated based on the same rules.

+---------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
| Validation          | no validation parameter set | validation parameter set |
+=====================+=============================+==========================+
| modify value        | check chaincode ep          | check key-level ep       |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+
| modify key-level ep | check chaincode ep          | check key-level ep       |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------+

As we discussed above, if a key is modified and no key-level endorsement policy
is present, the chaincode-level endorsement policy applies by default. This is
also true when a key-level endorsement policy is set for a key for the first time
--- the new key-level endorsement policy must first be endorsed according to the
pre-existing chaincode-level endorsement policy.

If a key is modified and a key-level endorsement policy is present, the key-level
endorsement policy overrides the chaincode-level endorsement policy. In practice,
this means that the key-level endorsement policy can be either less restrictive
or more restrictive than the chaincode-level endorsement policy. Because the
chaincode-level endorsement policy must be satisfied in order to set a key-level
endorsement policy for the first time, no trust assumptions have been violated.

If a key's endorsement policy is removed (set to nil), the chaincode-level
endorsement policy becomes the default again.

If a transaction modifies multiple keys with different associated key-level
endorsement policies, all of these policies need to be satisfied in order
for the transaction to be valid.
