# peer logging

The `peer logging` subcommand allows administrators to dynamically view and
configure the log levels of a peer.

## Syntax

The `peer logging` command has the following subcommands:

  * getlevel
  * setlevel
  * revertlevels

The different subcommand options (getlevel, setlevel, and revertlevels) relate
to the different logging operations that are relevant to a peer.

Each peer logging subcommand is described together with its options in its own
section in this topic.
